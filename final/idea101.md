- Description:

3D printing, similar to regular printing of 2d and flat media, is used and was thought up as a way
to create an existing object/document a replicate it in a physical form or copy. 3D printing
duplicates this form as a life object, a 3d version of it. This type of technology was first invented in the 1980's where a
few prototypes of the machine were made and the idea was made public. Hideo Kodama was the first person to
try and patent his idea of Rapid Prototyping. The first successful patent was made by Charles Hull in 1986.In 2009,
the patent on the 3D printer was dropped and the public was able to use and research the technology. Back in 2010, the printers go larger
and the first body of a full sized car was made. These machines used to be up to thousands of dollars
when they first came to the public, now there are simple machines that sell for 2 or 3 hundred.
