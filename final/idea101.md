3D Printing Research

- Description:

3D printing, similar to regular printing of 2d and flat media, is used and was thought up as a way
to create an existing object/document a replicate it in a physical form or copy. 3D printing
duplicates this form as a life object, a 3d version of it. This type of technology was first invented in the 1980's where a few prototypes of the machine were made and the idea
was introduced to the public. Hideo Kodama was the first person to try and patent his idea of Rapid
Prototyping. Kodama was a doctor at Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research institute who experimented and
invented the first rapid prototyping system in Japan. This machine had a roll of photopolymer material which was exposed to
UV light and hardened as it built up is layers. He wished to patent and develop this idea even further but their were
funding issues and the contract fell later that year.
The first successful patent was made by Charles Hull in 1986. Hull is the Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of 3D Systems
in NYSE. He was originally an engineer and received multiple awards, including Entrepreneur
pf the Year and the William T. Ennor Manufacturing Technology Award. Hull was the first to be known as inventing
stereolithography, or 3D printing technology and made a whole industry with it starting in 1986.
In 2009, the patent on the 3D printer was dropped and the public was able to use and research the technology. This made FDM printer prices drop from $10,000 to $1,000 or less. New companies and manufacturers got a hold and developed their own 3D printers; some companies include MakerBot and Ultimaker.
 Back in 2010, the printers got more popular and worked on a full scale, the first body of a full sized car was made. Price wise, these machines used to be up to thousands of dollars when they first came to the public, now there are simple machines that sell for 2 or 3 hundred dollars as well as filaments that are varies colors for $30 or $50. There are also varies materials that companies are making their printers use including liquids, metals, concrete, powder and anything imaginable other than air, for now.
 Another patent expired in December of 2016, which was held by Germanys Fraunhofer Institute. Whenever a new patent for certain material or types of 3D printers expire, the cost of the printers goes down dramatically and even more development and production takes place. The technology is only further being experimented with and expanding its materials, as well as what can be 3D printed, whether it be everyday items, cars, houses, organs and even maybe someday trees.
