I am in disbelief how advanced these machines are becoming, taking me out of business.
 I used to start my morning up in the old grind building car parts, making sure the
 vendor gets what they need. Now, I can barely find someone to hire me. Yah, I got
 fired recently and I should've seen it coming. Every industry has been buying those
  3D printers, they said it would only be to experiment and develop the programs but
  of course the next step is for those darn machines to run me out of my job. They
  found a way to 3D print with metals and other materials to make almost anything they
   need. Of course they still need designers, but, manufactures not so much. I told them
   to let me keep my job and just let me spray paint the cars or something along those
   lines, but these printers have color as well. What am I going to do, almost every
   industry is switching to 3D printing, they said it was too expensive at first, but,
    they found a cheaper way to get the filaments and its cheaper to get a few machines
    then to pay more than a hundred people. Maybe I should change my profession to be
    the person that takes care and fixes those printers. Oh, well maybe in my next life.

Iâ€™ve been stacking in those dollars these past few years and my luck just keeps increasing.
I am in the filament industry, if you don't know what that means have you been living under 
a rock. You know those 3D printers, yup, they need filament so why not make a whole industry
developing such filament. Working with the 3D printer companies and developing all types of
 material to be functional and compatible for the new printers. They made printers for almost
 everything you can think of. Making buildings, cars, toys, you name it they got it, all with
  our help of course. Making metal filaments is no easy task, but with the help of some
  scientist we got it all going. Now we make billions and are a top selling company, me being
  the head CEO of the company and getting the profit and the recognition. If you don't know
   me by name I am positive you have seen my face online or in the news. Either way, this is
   the new standard of easy living, if you can't build it just print it!
