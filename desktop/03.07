Idea No. 12: Bulletin Board Systems


 Some BBS names were “Octopus’s Garden,” “Southern Pride,” and “Online's Place.” The
 Hayes Smartmodern was able to connect people to the server and was a type of router.
 Apple also was in this market and had the Appl II BBA, there was alos Atari 8 bit Family were
 you can chat and interact with others.
 There are a few BBS that are still up and runnign today inlcuding SyncTerm, which directs
 you to a website that has links and servers to click into. There were a few links I found
 that open a direct terminal and download into your computer. Or you need to download
 the Telnet address then you are able to see and use the Bulletin that way, heatwave.ddns.net
 still is up. There was also a game like BBS server still up called The Forgotten World of
 BBS Door Games.

Idea No. 36: GeoCities


Websites like the wayback machine and other mini blog or websites have bits and
pieces of old GeoCities servers still able to be viewed. There are links to archives
that users created before the information was deleted by saving the page and website, these
people, as far as I have researched, are web archivists or web crawlers. They tend to
collect web pages by accessing the data of the website and use Heritrix, HTTrack and Wget
to archive the sites. Now you can archive a site by saving the page and having your own
permanent URL of the page at that time. People did the same with Geocities and now There
are torrents and URL links for GeoCities servers.
