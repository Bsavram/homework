GPS-
Even thought the first Satellite was launched in 1957, this was
only able to transmit radio signals and of course, was only
used by scientists and government officials. The Navy was the first
to use navigation tracking system, called TRANSIT, used to locate
other sub marines. Cars suddenly developed GPS trackers for
navigating streets starting in 2001. In 2012 there are currently 31
operational GPS satellites and a few others that can be activated
if need be. The newest satellite launch was in 2014. In 2010, even until
the present, the Air Force develops and improves the accuracy of the GPS
not only for their own needs but the rest of the people.

Rover-
The first ever Rover was built in 1969 and was used to go around the moon,
able to be controlled by a remote. There are still current Rover mentions, but,
they aim to go a greater distance, such as the Mars exploration from 2004 until
2018 where images and information of Mars was finally seen. In 2012, another Rover was
successfully launched and is now exploring whether or not Mars is an acceptable
planet to sustain life. The new rovers are able to analyze the surface of the
planet as well as what history it went through in order to access the living
conditions. This new project is set for Mars 2020.

Oculas rift-
In 2012, Palmer decided to go on Kickstart to start raising money for the Oculas
virtual headset. There were around 100 enthusiast as well as 2,750 others on Kickstart
and he was able to raise about 2 billion dollars for the machine. In 2014 they were able to make
and sell their first model, selling nearly 65,000 units. Today, companies such as facebook aquired
oculas for $2 billion

Tesla Model 3
The car that drives itself was always a far fetched idea, one saw in movies but impractical in
real life. In 2018 this fantasy was made a reality when the Tesla was made, the first introduction of
the car was made in 2016 where they had over 325,000 reservations for the car, sales went over
$14 billion. On July 1st, 2018 the car was introduced and was the best selling all-electric car in
the U.S.

Metal 3D printing
3D printing is still a new technology, having machines print out plastic filament in the shape
of anything you can imagine. The first ones shown and developed for the public were around the
early 2010's but they were and still are on the pricey side. 3D printers were invented back in the
1980's but were the size of a person, even larger. These printers came with many complications
including how people would use them, back in 2013 a man made a working 3D printed gun, in just 3
days the design got removed but these ideas could always be made into reality. New innovations and
research into developing these printers has made them able to build houses, bridges and plans for
skyscrapers are popping up. Now, 3D printers can print with metals and other building material, not
just the plastic tubes.
