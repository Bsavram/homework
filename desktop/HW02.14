idea No.19: The Emoticon
What is a 'flame war' and what does it have to do with emoticons?
When the students wanted to make a joke online people often took it seriously because they
couldn't read the expression and the actual intention of the user. A flame war would be when
 everyone just starts to bash one another and get more serious, not the original intention of
  the first joke that was out on there. Emoticons help the person identify if it was a serious
  thought or if it was just a light hearted joke. The smiley face was to show a joke and the
  frown was for serious statements.

What's the difference between an emoticon and an emoji? Support your answer with references beyond the book.
The emoticon was the sideways representation of faces and emotions that can
be typed and used with symbols on a keyboard. The emoji was invented in Japan
 and featured the first ever horizontal face without the “tilted head”. It
 featured the whole face put in parenthesis and these grew to the emojis we
 have today with a whole face and colored graphic. There are now emojis spread
 past the face and body and can represent almost everything in the world with
 a small picture and a tap of your finger.

Idea No.24: The JPEG
Boulton explains that a JPEG file has 'lossy' compression. Explain what this means.
List and explain a few other kinds of image file compression and the image file types associated with them.
A lossy compression is one that has been shrunk down from its originally large file size. In the case of
Jpegs, the amount of color changes in the image, the squares and pixels also shrink,
as well as the blocks in order to view and find the image faster on the web and be able
to store the image without losing so much space. The GIF is another compression they mentioned
where it changes high resolution video or images into a smaller size. With GIF, this is considered a
lossless compression.

Idea No.45: Metadata
List and explain a few examples of metadata beyond the examples given in the book.
There are various types of Metadata found all over the internet from the web browser
to websites that let you search for keywords. Every website has one, facebook to search
up your friends, libraries to search books by author, tittle or year. Even apps on the
phone such as instagram has keywords or even hashtags to quickly guide the user to an
image they wanted to view.
