In your own words explain what the Internet is and how it came to be. Give both a technical
explination (that a regular person would understand) as well as historical context.

The internet is a kind of infrastructure were users are able to connect with one another
through games, media such as email and websites connected through the world wide web,  basically
the internet is a tool to talk and interact with other people or get information and send
messages to and from others. In a technical stand point, the internet delivers its information
in packets with the term called packet switching. This information was sent through networks of
communications, at first connected by wires and then traveling through space or the air, then being
rearranged at the person that it was being sent to.
